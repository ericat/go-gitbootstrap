## go-gitbootstrap
Creates a simple .gitconfig file with good defaults.

Important: the "editors" settings will not work in Windows - a full path to the
executable has to be passed in, and the path changes based on your OS.

Todo:
* Add web browser field
* Add comments to template to explain settings
* Executable
* Update README

Nice have:
* Add reset option
* Show config
* Show config global, local, system
